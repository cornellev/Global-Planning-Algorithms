Run `pip install pygame`

EP-Informed Hybrid: Mix of ellipse + EP-RRT*, better for speed on all types of maps (maze, obstacles, etc)

Informed RRT Star: RRT star with elliptic simplification, slightly better shortest path guarantee / smoothness

Simple RRT: Basic RRT algorithm, generating random points with a bias implemented
